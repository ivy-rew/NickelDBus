## NickelDBus Go CLI client

**THIS TOOL IS DEPRECATED IN FAVOUR OF 'QNDB'. IT IS KEPT AS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO USE GO D-BUS BINDINGS**

This is a CLI tool written in Go to interface with NickelDBus. It can be compiled with Go 1.14+.

Development has been abandoned, it (probably) still works, but has not been tested since the introduction of `qndb`.
