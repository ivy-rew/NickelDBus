    \title NickelDBus

    \section1 Introduction

    NickelDBus is a mod for Kobo e-readers. Heavily inspired by 
    \l {https://github.com/pgaskin/NickelMenu}{NickelMenu}, it
    allows developers to perform many of the same actions as NickelMenu, but
    from scripts or programs, instead of from the UI.

    As well as the ability to trigger actions, NickelDBus also allows you to
    wait on a limited selection of signals. Such signals include knowing when
    the content import process has completed, or whether WiFi has connected, 
    among others.

    This is all achieved through the magic of d-bus. NickelDBus registers itself
    on the \c system bus.

    You can follow the development of NickelDBus at the 
    \l {https://github.com/shermp/NickelDBus}{GitHub repository}. 

    \section1 Installation

    Installing NickelDBus is simple. Simply go to the 
    \l {https://github.com/shermp/NickelDBus/releases/latest}{latest release} page and
    download the \c KoboRoot.tgz file.

    Copy the downloaded \c KoboRoot.tgz to the \c .kobo directory on the root
    of your kobo when plugged into USB. Eject/disconnect your Kobo, and it will
    automatically install itself.

    There is no need to configure anything after installation.

    \note NickelDBus should survive factory resets.

    \note to check what version of NickelDBus you have installed, open the file 
    `.adds/nickeldbus` in a text editor. Applications should use the provided 
    \c ndbVersion method to get the current NickelDBus version instead of 
    parsing this file.

    \section1 Upgrading

    To upgrade NickelDBus, simply follow the same procedure as installing it.

    \section1 Uninstallation

    If you ever want to remove NickelDBus, simply connect your Kobo to your
    computer over USB and delete the file called \c nickeldbus in the \c .adds 
    directory.

    Then disconnect your Kobo, and reboot. NickelDBus should now be removed.

    \section1 Developer Documentation

    \note Please do not directly install NickelDBus when installing your own
    application. If you wish to include NickelDBus as a convenience for 
    your users, consider performing an install or upgrade (never downgrade) 
    during your application start-up process.

    NickelDBus presents itself on the d-bus \c system bus. It has an interface
    of \c com.github.shermp.nickeldbus and a path of \c /nickeldbus.

    To interact with NickelDBus, you can use language bindings for your favourite
    programming language. Most if not all languages have bindings available.

    \section2 Usage

    \section3 CLI Tools

    Shell script users may use the standard \c dbus-send and \c dbus-monitor tools.
    Programs like qdbus and gdbus are also available.

    Alternatively, NickelDBus installs a small tool called \c qndb if you wish to
    use it. \c qndb allows you to call a method, or wait for a signal, or call
    a method then wait for a signal.

    \section4 qndb

    The \c qndb usage is as follows:

    \code
        Usage: qndb [options] [args...]
        Qt CLI for NickelDBus

        Options:
          -h, --help                  Displays this help.
          -v, --version               Displays version information.
          -s, --signal <signal name>  Wait for signal, and prints its output, if any.
          -t, --timeout <timeout ms>  Signal timeout in milliseconds.
          -m, --method <method name>  Method to invoke.
          -a, --api                   Print API usage

        Arguments:
         arguments                   Arguments to pass to method. Have no affect when
                                     a method is not set. 
    \endcode

    And here are a few examples:

    Print the current NickelDBus version
    \code qndb -m ndbVersion \endcode

    Show a toast on-screen for 3 seconds, with message 'Hello World!':
    \code qndb -m mwcToast 3000 "Hello World" \endcode

    Trigger library rescan, and wait for content import to complete, with a 30 second timeout:
    \code qndb -t 30000 -s pfmDoneProcessing -m pfmRescanBooksFull \endcode

    \note Even though \c qndb may time out, the content import process will not be aborted. 

    \section3 Language Bindings

    Most languages will have d-bus bindings available. NickelDBus and \c qndb were written
    in Qt using QtDBus. 

    \section3 API Documentation

    The API is documented \l {NDB::NDBDbus}{here}. It is Qt based documentation, but it should
    be easy to determine what's needed for other languages or CLI tools.

    \section2 Compiling NickelDBus

    NickelDBus is a Qt and C++ based project. It was designed to be used with 
    \l {https://github.com/pgaskin/NickelTC}{NickelTC}. As such, the Makefile expects that
    to be available.

    To build everything from scratch, run:
    \code make clean && make && make cli && make koboroot \endcode

    That will compile the library, \c qndb and package it up into a \c KoboRoot.tgz ready to
    be installed onto a Kobo.

    To make this documentation, run
    \code make doc \endcode

    If you are developing NickelDBus, you will probably want to run 
    \code make interface \endcode

    if you haven't already run \c make so that you have the auto-generated adapter and proxy
    code and header files.
